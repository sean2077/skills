# `deep-interview` — reference

On-demand reference for the `deep-interview` skill. `SKILL.md` keeps the operational
contract resident (threshold math, the one-question rule, the Round 0 topology gate,
per-round scoring obligations, and the no-implementation handoff). This file holds the
verbose material that is only needed at specific moments.

**Hosts that do not auto-load bundled files:** read this file explicitly when `SKILL.md`
tells you to — before the first ambiguity score (*Scoring rubric*) and at spec
crystallization (*Spec template*).

## Scoring rubric

Reuse this exact prompt to score **every** round (verbatim each round → low variance).
When the transcript is long, delegate scoring to a subagent with this rubric plus the
prompt-safe transcript.

```
Given the following interview transcript for a {greenfield|brownfield} project, score clarity on each dimension from 0.0 to 1.0. If the initial context or transcript was summarized for prompt safety, score from that summary plus the preserved round decisions/gaps; do not re-expand raw oversized context. Honor the locked Round 0 topology: score every active component independently and never drop confirmed sibling components just because one component is already clear.

Original idea or prompt-safe initial-context summary: {idea_or_initial_context_summary}

Transcript or prompt-safe transcript summary:
{all rounds Q&A or summarized transcript}

Locked topology:
{state.topology.components and state.topology.deferrals}

Score each active component on each dimension, then provide the overall dimension scores as the minimum or coverage-weighted weakest score across active components. Deferred components are excluded from ambiguity math but must remain listed in topology and the final spec.

Score each dimension:
1. Goal Clarity (0.0-1.0): Is the primary objective unambiguous? Can you state it in one sentence without qualifiers? Can you name the key entities (nouns) and their relationships (verbs) without ambiguity?
2. Constraint Clarity (0.0-1.0): Are the boundaries, limitations, and non-goals clear?
3. Success Criteria Clarity (0.0-1.0): Could you write a test that verifies success? Are acceptance criteria concrete?
{4. Context Clarity (0.0-1.0): [brownfield only] Do we understand the existing system well enough to modify it safely? Do the identified entities map cleanly to existing codebase structures?}

For each dimension provide:
- score: float (0.0-1.0)
- justification: one sentence explaining the score
- gap: what's still unclear (if score < 0.9)

Also identify:
- weakest_component_id: the active component with the lowest clarity after applying rotation across components when N > 1
- weakest_dimension: the single lowest-confidence dimension for that component this round
- weakest_dimension_rationale: one sentence explaining why this component/dimension pair is the highest-leverage target for the next question
- component_scores: object keyed by component id, with per-dimension scores and gaps

5. Ontology Extraction: Identify all key entities (nouns) discussed in the transcript.

{If round > 1, inject: "Previous round's entities: {prior_entities_json from state.ontology_snapshots[-1]}. REUSE these entity names where the concept is the same. Only introduce new names for genuinely new concepts."}

For each entity provide:
- name: string (the entity name, e.g., "User", "Order", "PaymentMethod")
- type: string (e.g., "core domain", "supporting", "external system")
- fields: string[] (key attributes mentioned)
- relationships: string[] (e.g., "User has many Orders")

Respond as JSON. Include an additional "ontology" key containing the entities array alongside the dimension scores.

## Spec template

Write the final spec to `.omc/specs/deep-interview-{slug}.md` using this structure:

```markdown
# Deep Interview Spec: {title}

## Metadata
- Interview ID: {uuid}
- Rounds: {count}
- Final Ambiguity Score: {score}%
- Type: greenfield | brownfield
- Generated: {timestamp}
- Threshold: {threshold}
- Threshold Source: <resolvedThresholdSource>
- Initial Context Summarized: {yes|no}
- Status: {PASSED | BELOW_THRESHOLD_EARLY_EXIT}

## Clarity Breakdown
| Dimension | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Goal Clarity | {s} | {w} | {s*w} |
| Constraint Clarity | {s} | {w} | {s*w} |

| Context Clarity | {s} | {w} | {s*w} |
| **Total Clarity** | | | **{total}** |
| **Ambiguity** | | | **{1-total}** |

## Topology
{List every Round 0 confirmed top-level component. Active components must have coverage notes; deferred components must include the user-confirmed deferral reason and timestamp.}

| Component | Status | Description | Coverage / Deferral Note |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| {component.name} | {active|deferred} | {component.description} | {covered acceptance criteria or deferral reason} |

## Goal
{crystal-clear goal statement derived from interview, covering every active topology component}

## Constraints
- {constraint 1}
- {constraint 2}
- ...

## Non-Goals
- {explicitly excluded scope 1}
- {explicitly excluded scope 2}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {testable criterion 1}

## Assumptions Exposed & Resolved
| Assumption | Challenge | Resolution |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| {assumption} | {how it was questioned} | {what was decided} |

## Technical Context
{brownfield: relevant codebase findings from the `Explore` subagent or the host-neutral read/search fallback}
{greenfield: technology choices and constraints}

## Ontology (Key Entities)
{Fill from the FINAL round's ontology extraction, not just crystallization-time generation}

### Configuration

Threshold precedence: depth flag (`--quick` 0.30 / `--standard` 0.20 / `--deep` 0.10) > project settings > user settings > default 0.2. Optional settings key (kept compatible with the original OMC name) in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "omc": {
    "deepInterview": {
      "ambiguityThreshold": 0.2,
      "maxRounds": 20,
      "softWarningRounds": 10,
      "minRoundsBeforeExit": 3,
      "enableChallengeAgents": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Resume

If interrupted, run `/deep-interview` again. The skill reads state from `.omc/state/deep-interview-state.json` and resumes from the last completed round.

### Brownfield vs Greenfield Weights

| Dimension | Greenfield | Brownfield |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Goal Clarity | 40% | 35% |
| Constraint Clarity | 30% | 25% |
| Success Criteria | 30% | 25% |
| Context Clarity | N/A | 15% |

Brownfield adds Context Clarity because modifying existing code safely requires understanding the system being changed.

### Challenge Agent Modes

| Mode | Activates | Purpose | Prompt Injection |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Contrarian | Round 4+ | Challenge assumptions | "What if the opposite were true?" |
| Simplifier | Round 6+ | Remove complexity | "What's the simplest version?" |
| Ontologist | Round 8+ (if ambiguity > 0.3) | Find essence | "What IS this, really?" |

Each mode is used exactly once, then normal Socratic questioning resumes. Modes are tracked in state to prevent repetition.

### Ambiguity Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Meaning | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 0.0 - 0.1 | Crystal clear | Proceed immediately |
| At or below the resolved threshold | Clear enough | Proceed |
| Above the resolved threshold with minor gaps | Some gaps | Continue interviewing |
| Moderate ambiguity | Significant gaps | Focus on weakest dimensions |
| High ambiguity | Very unclear | May need reframing (Ontologist) |
| Extreme ambiguity | Almost nothing known | Early stages, keep going |
